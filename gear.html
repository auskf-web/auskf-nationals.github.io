				T-shirts ($25), a AUSKF National Championships tenugui ($10), and a AUSKF Junior Open National Championships tenugui ($10) can be pre-ordered during the registration process (through your federation representative) and will also be available for purchase at the tournament. 
				We recommend you pre-order instead of waiting to purchase at the tournament as some items and particular t-shirt sizes sell out quickly. 
				<br><br>
				Please note that all kenshi participating in the tournament will receive a complimentary tenugui for that tournament. For example, a competitor in the AUSKF Junior Open National Championships will receive a AUSKF Junior Open National Championships tenugui.  
				<br><br>
				All three items feature kanji selected and drawn by <strong>Masaharu Kakehashi Sensei, 8-Dan Hanshi</strong>: Sei Ken Fu Metsu (Correct Sword Never Extinguishes). 
				This simple but powerful phrase emphasizes that the true and correct way of the sword (kendo) is eternal and will never extinguish or cease to exist.
